# Welcome to my Typescript Drag and Drop Project

This project was created as a part of my Typescript learning experience (Related Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript)

Fabulous fun course and project, I was able to learn the differences between vanilla JS and Typescript. A few key things I learned from this course:
- How to develop using Typescript only
- Configure the compiler to optimal settings for this project
- Inheritance and Encapsulation in Typescript to maintain the code modular and avoid duplication
- Object-oriented approach to Typescript / JS
- Organizing the project files into a folder structure that's easy to find files

The final demo video is made available on YouTube for reference: https://youtu.be/TDGZCn2c02s

## How to run this project

First, run ```npm install``` to install the dependencies, then run the ```npm start``` command to initialize the server (a new tab will automatically open in your browser). The ```tsc``` command compiles any changes made.
